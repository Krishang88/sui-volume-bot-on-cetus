# Security Guide

## Overview

This document outlines security best practices for using the SUI Volume Bot.

## Private Key Security

### Storage
- Never store private keys in plain text
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Consider using hardware wallets for large amounts
- Implement key rotation policies

### Access Control
- Limit access to private keys
- Use dedicated wallets for bot operations
- Implement multi-signature wallets for large operations
- Regular access audits

## Network Security

### RPC Endpoints
- Use trusted RPC providers
- Implement endpoint rotation
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Use HTTPS/WSS connections

### Firewall Configuration
- Restrict access to necessary ports
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor network traffic
- Use VPN for remote access

## Transaction Security

### Validation
- Verify transaction parameters
- Implement amount limits
- Check recipient addresses
- Validate pool configurations

### Monitoring
- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Alert on unusual patterns
- Track gas fee anomalies
- Monitor balance changes

## Environment Security

### Configuration
- Secure environment file storage
- Use secrets management systems
- Implement configuration validation
- Regular security updates

### Access Control
- Restrict file permissions
- Use non-root users
- Implement audit logging
- Regular access reviews

## Best Practices

### General Security
1. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
2. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging
3. **Backup**: Regular data backups
4. **Testing**: Security testing in staging
5. **Documentation**: Maintain security procedures

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Monitor for security events
2. **Response**: Immediate incident response
3. **Recovery**: Quick recovery procedures
4. **Analysis**: Post-incident analysis
5. **Prevention**: Implement preventive measures

## Compliance

### Regulatory Requirements
- Understand local regulations
- Implement compliance measures
- Regular compliance audits
- Documentation requirements

### Data Protection
- Implement data encryption
- Secure data transmission
- Regular data audits
- Privacy protection measures

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Stop
```bash
# Stop the bot immediately
docker-compose down
# or
pkill -f "node index.js"
```

### Wallet Recovery
1. Secure the compromised wallet
2. Transfer funds to safe wallet
3. Update configuration
4. Investigate the incident

### System Recovery
1. Assess the damage
2. Restore from backups
3. Update security measures
4. Resume operations
